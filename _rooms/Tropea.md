Tropea is a small village on the west coast of the region of Calabria, in southern Italy. It is famous mainly for its clifftop historic center, beaches, stunning landscapes and prized red onions. Due to the crystal clear water of its beaches and the beauty of the town itself, Tropea is dubbed as the "Pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea" and was elected in 2021 as the most beautiful Italian village. You will be free to explore the town and its main beaches, restaurants and bars during the extended lunch breaks, and most evenings.
