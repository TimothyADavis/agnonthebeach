<h2>Workshop Overview</h2>

Relativistic radio-emitting jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) likely play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. By transferring a fraction of their kinetic energy to the surrounding medium (the so-called “kinetic-mode” AGN feedback), radio jets can both quench (negative feedback) and promote (positive feedback) star formation, thus regulating the growth of both central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. One of the most spectacular phenomena associated with relativistic jets is indeed the creation of cavities and shocks in the hot X-ray-emitting atmospheres of galaxies, groups, and clusters, providing the most striking evidence that expanding radio jets can heat the surroundings, balancing its spontaneous radiative cooling losses. 

Complementing earlier high-resolution radio, optical, and X-ray instruments (e.g. VLA, HST, Chandra, XMM-Newton), the unprecedented resolution and sensitivity provided by the latest generation of telescopes (e.g. VLT/MUSE, ALMA and the SKA precursors/pathfinders) combined with state-of-the-art simulations, have opened up new regimes that have started revolutionising our view of the interplay between the radio jets and their surrounding medium. For instance, evidence has been accumulated over the past few years that jet-mode feedback can significantly alter the distribution, kinematics, and physics of the surrounding gaseous medium also on (sub-)kpc scales, with a few examples starting to appear at high redshift as well. Recent observations also suggest that jetted AGN may be self-regulated by a feeding and feedback loop, in which the matter that fuels the SMBH and triggers the jet activity gets regularly heated by these latter and stops being accreted, setting-up a cycle that is fast compared to the evolutionary timescales of the host galaxies. All this provides clear evidence of a deep connection between the large-scale environment, fuelling/feedback processes of jetted AGN and their host galaxy evolution, although the complexity of these phenomena still leave many open questions. 

With the advent of next-generation telescopes (e.g. JWST, SKA, Athena), we are at the brink of an exciting new era of discoveries in terms of jetted AGN physics, including their role in the high-redshift universe, which will surely translate to a broader understanding of galaxy evolution across cosmic times. The aim of this workshop is to summarise and discuss our state of knowledge on this topic. We will focus on the results obtained from the wealth of multi-wavelength observations acquired over the past few years, including complementary theoretical understanding, and look towards future perspectives in the context of forthcoming facilities. In particular, we aim to address the following scientific topics:

- Gas replenishing mechanism(s) and the role of the large-scale environment
- Fuelling processes on (sub-)kpc scales and jet powering mechanisms
- Jet-induced feedback on circumgalactic and extragalactic scales
- Jet-ISM interaction on (sub-)kpc scales (positive vs negative feedback)
- AGN duty cycle


<h2>Meeting Format</h2>

The workshop will be hosted at the historic [Palazzo Santa Chiara](/rooms/Palazzo-Santa-Chiara/) in the centre of [Tropea](/rooms/Tropea/), with five days of scientific presentations and discussions. We aim to include long lunch breaks to allow you to relax, discuss, and explore the historic town and beautiful beaches with your colleagues. 

The workshop is limited to 70 attendees to enable effective discussion. We aim to make the workshop a safe space for all, and as such the meeting will have a [Code of Conduct](/coc/). Registering for the meeting signifies that you agree to abide by this code of conduct, and accept the sanctions within it may apply if you break it. 

The organisers are monitering the ongoing situation surrounding coronavirus, and will update the website with further information on the requirements regarding this as the workshop comes nearer. 

<h2>Registration and Abstract submission</h2>

Abstract submission will open in due course. If you are interested in recieving our announcements when this happens, please express interest via the button at the bottom of this page. Abstract reviews will be conducted in a double-blind fashion to avoid unconcious biases. The full registration page will be opened shortly after the abstract deadline. 

Information on the conference fee will be provided soon on this website.<!-- of YYY euros. --> 
We anticipate that the registration fee will cover use of the Venue, a Welcome reception on Sunday, coffee breaks, the conference dinner, and a bus transfer to/from the Lamezia Terme airport. 

The majority of the scientific programme will be based on submitted abstracts and is expected to be announced in early June.
