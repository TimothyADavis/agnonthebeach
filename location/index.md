<!-- How to get to the conference

You can adapt the design as well as the section shown on the map by copying the `assets/js/main.js` from the theme's repository and editing it. See also the subsection [Location / Room Overview](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference/#location--room-overview) section of the theme's README file. -->

The workshop will be held in Tropea, a small village on the west coast of Calabria, in southern Italy. Find out more about the town [here](/rooms/Tropea/). The scientific sessions will be held in [Palazzo Santa Chiara](/rooms/Palazzo-Santa-Chiara/), a historic building in the heart of the town.

### Travel
<b>By air</b><br>
The nearest airport is [Lamezia Terme](https://lameziaairport.com/) (SUF). This is located about 60 km North from Tropea and is served daily by flights to/from popular domestic and international destinations. Dedicated bus transfers to/from the airport at specified times will be offered and we aim to include them in the registration fee. 
<!-- The busses will depart at time X, Y and Z, and return at times A, B and C. -->

<b>By train</b><br>
Tropea has a small railway station, located at walkable distance to the town centre, but served only by the local train network. The easiest way to get to Tropea by train is to arrive to the Lamezia Terme railway station, which instead offers high-speed (or regular) direct connections to all the main Italian cities. From there, local trains to Tropea depart every hour. 

<b>By car</b><br>
A modern motorway, called the "Motorway of the Mediterranean" (ex A3), allows you to get close to Tropea from any Italian and international city. The motorway exit nearest to Tropea is "Pizzo Calabro", located  about 35 km North.
