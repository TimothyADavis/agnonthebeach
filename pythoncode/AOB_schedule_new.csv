Fuelling processes on (sub-)kpc scales,"Since the 1970s, astronomers have struggled with the issue of how matter
can be accreted to promote black hole growth. While low-angular-momentum
stars may be devoured by the black hole, they are not a sustainable source
of fuel. Gas, which could potentially provide an abundant fuel source,
presents another challenge due to its enormous angular momentum.
While viscous torques are not significant, gas is subject to gravity torques
from non-axisymmetric potentials such as bars and spirals. Primary bars
can exchange angular momentum with the gas inside corotation, driving
it inward spiraling until the inner Lindblad resonance is reached.
An embedded nuclear bar can then take over. As the gas reaches the black
hole's sphere of influence, the torque turns negative, fueling the center.
Dynamical friction also accelerates the infall of gas clouds closer to
the nucleus. However, due to the Eddington limit, growing a black hole from
a stellar-mass seed is a slow process. The existence of very massive black
holes in the early universe remains a puzzle that could potentially be
solved through direct collapse of massive clouds into black holes or
super-Eddington accretion.",Francoise Combes,Invited,Fuelling,False,09:10,09:40,Monday,,,,,,
On the origin of radio-loudness in active galactic nuclei using far-infrared polarimetric observations,"To explain the transfer of energy surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBH), most of the theoretical models, if not all, must incorporate magnetic fields (B-fields)—matter rotating around an SMBH must have a B-field to account for the loss of angular momentum. Although this process can explain the dynamics of matter at sub-pc scales, there are still no clear observations of how the matter from the host galaxy, which contains kpc-scale B-fields in close equipartition with the diffuse ISM, feeds SMBHs at 10-100pc-scales.

We have observed the signature of magnetically aligned dust grains at distances of a few 10pc at infrared/sub-mm wavelengths in a sample of RL and RQ AGN. We found that RQ AGN are low polarized, while RL AGN are highly polarized at 10-100um. These results are particularly interesting because the dusty torus represents the AGN accretion flow on pc-scales, and this result, besides the radio differences, may be the most telling and dramatic empirical difference between RL vs. RQ AGN. For RL AGN, the B-fields at pc-scales may be able to compress and sustain the dusty torus, which extends the inflow/outflow processes from sub-pc scales to pc-scales and links the inflow and outflow with the dynamics of the host galaxy.",Enrique Lopez Rodriguez,Contributed,Fuelling,False,09:40,09:55,Monday,,,,,,
Observing AGN fuelling via molecular absorption lines,"AGN and their jets are, to a large extent, powered by the accretion of cold molecular gas. Unfortunately, observing this gas on small spatial scales is difficult because it can normally only be seen en masse through emission lines.

I will present observations of the molecular gas in massive galaxies on scales of just tens to hundreds of solar masses. We see the gas on this incredibly small mass scale using high angular resolution observations of the galaxies’ bright and extremely compact continuum sources — against which we see the shadows of gas clouds in the form of absorption lines. Our ALMA surveys of several galaxies have detected dozens of ~100 solar mass molecular clouds.

The velocities of the clouds are revealed by the absorption’s redshift and in many cases, they’re moving towards their supermassive black hole at several hundred km/s. I will explain how these observations show the early stages of individual clouds accreting onto their host AGN.

Characteristics of the absorption lines, such as their strength and width, can then be used to infer the clouds’ mass, temperature, and chemistry. Through this, we show that the gas fuelling AGN and their jets has remarkably similar properties to gas present in the Milky Way.",Tom Rose,Contributed,Fuelling,False,09:55,10:10,Monday,,,,,,
"The link between circumnuclear molecular gas reservoirs, millimetre continua and active galactic nucleus fuelling","Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist in almost all massive galaxies, and accretion of material onto these SMBHs is known to power active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this talk, I will the present results obtained by analysing ALMA data of a diverse sample of 35 nearby galaxies to study the link between circumnuclear (≤100pc) molecular gas reservoirs and AGN fuelling to better understand the powering mechanism. We find that the cold molecular gas mass within the nuclear regions does not correlate with any measure of AGN activity. This suggests that the AGN fuelling is not a ubiquitous process, even when cold gas is present. I will then discuss the origin of the nuclear mm emission in these sources. We find a strong relation between the nuclear mm emission from our galaxies and the SMBH mass, and an even tighter correlation is observed if the 2-10 keV X-ray emission is included. Classic torus models cannot explain the existence of the observed correlations, that we find instead naturally arising from advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This result suggests that radiatively-inefficient processes are ongoing in our sources (spanning a wide range of AGN types), and provides a new method to indirectly measure SMBH masses.",Jacob Elford,Contributed,Fuelling,False,10:10,10:25,Monday,,,,,,

Gas replenishing mechanism(s) and the role of the large-scale environment,"The observed coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies is partly due to the fact that both feed on gas accreting into the central region of galaxies. Indeed, recent stellar population studies of the inner kpc of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosts – where the nuclear SMBH is growing, indicate an excess of young to intermediate age (~100 Myr) stars. This suggests that the AGN triggering occurs following a gas inflow that forms stars in its way towards the galaxy nucleus. I will discuss what we know about the large scale environment of AGN and signatures of their triggering: in the most luminous sources, major mergers are frequent, while in low  luminosity AGNs subtle asymmetries on the host galaxy images also suggest external gas capture – e.g. via chaotic cold accretion, a minor merger or secular processes in the late-type host galaxies. While bars do not appear to directly feed AGNs, AGN flickering leads to the dissociation between small and large scales, hence affecting the interpretation of cause and effect. At ~100 pc scales, recent observations have revealed compact disks and inflows along nuclear gaseous spirals and bars, both in ionized and molecular gas, while chaotic cold accretion continues to feed luminous early-type galaxies at these scales.",Thaisa Storchi Bergmann,Invited,Fuelling,True,11:20,11:50,Monday,,,,,,
Mergers are the dominant trigger for high luminosity HERGs,"Considerable uncertainty remains about the triggering of radio AGN. Here we present the results of deep imaging observations of a large sample of high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) covering a wide range of radio power (10^22.5 <  L_1.4 < 10^28 W/Hz) and [OIII] emission line luminosity (10^32.5 <  L_[OIII]) < 10^36.5 W). We find that the rate of detection of tidal features suggestive of galaxy mergers increases with [OIII] emission-line luminosity. At the highest, quasar-like [OIII] luminosities (L_[OIII] > 10^35 W), the HERGs show a rate of morphological disturbance that is 3x higher than that of a sample of non-AGN control galaxies matched in stellar mass and redshift – similar to recent results for samples of nearby radio-quiet quasars. In contrast, at the lowest [OIII] luminosities the rate of morphological disturbance in the HERGs is consistent with that of the controls. Moreover, the overall morphologies of the host galaxies become increasing dominated by late-type morphologies at low luminosities. Overall, these results are consistent with galaxy mergers dominating the triggering of HERGs at high {OIII] luminosities, and secular processes becoming increasingly important at low luminosities.

Fuelling AGN with galaxy interactions,"Identifying black hole gas fuelling mechanisms is important to understand how supermassive black holes grow and what physical conditions favour the onset of black hole activity. However, it is challenging to find clear observational signatures of black hole fuelling. In this presentation I will show that galaxy interactions, such as major mergers, minor mergers or galaxy flybys, provide the necessary conditions to fuel AGN. I will describe how we use kinematically misaligned gas to observationally identify galaxies that went through an interaction. With this method we have recently shown that galaxies that have misaligned gas have a higher observed fraction of AGN. This is the first time that an observational connection is seen between the process of formation and/or presence of misaligned structures and the fuelling of active supermassive black holes. In this presentation I will also discuss the dependence of this trend on morphology and the incidence of radio, X-ray and optically detected AGN in galaxies with misaligned gas.",Sandra Raimundo,Contributed,Fuelling,False,12:05,12:20,Monday,,,,,,

Jet power across diverse AGN populations,"I will review methods for estimating the power of AGN jets, and what they can tell us about different AGN populations, their powering mechanisms, and their connection to environment. I will consider questions that include: the reliability of scaling relations between radio observables and jet power, the factors that influence them, how jet power scaling relations may evolve with redshift, and what information we need to work towards reliable estimates of jet impact at high redshift. I will also highlight the wealth of information that new radio surveys are providing to address these questions.",Judith Croston,Invited,Jet formation and physics,True,14:30,15:00,Monday,,,,,,
Studying the link between radio galaxies and AGN fuelling with relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of flickering jets,"Flickering variability is ubiquitous in accreting sources and occurs within the chaotic cold accretion model. In addition, jetted AGN show evidence of variability in their morphologies. Despite this, many theoretical studies focus on steady or ""on-off"" jets. I will present new work in which we characterise AGN jet variability as a noisy process, and conduct kpc-scale hydrodynamic simulations in which the jet power varies with flicker noise properties. We find the dynamics of the jet cocoon depend on the variability amplitude with a clear link between the cocoon shape and historical activity. The jet advances quickly during high states, whereas low states resemble Sedov blast waves. Periods of high activity create stronger backflow, and the variability leads to propagating internal shocks. In addition, we use synthetic images to show that jet variability creates dramatic changes in hotspot structure, lobe morphology and brightness distributions. We discuss various implications, including for observations and particle acceleration, and estimate the scatter introduced to power-luminosity correlations. Overall, we propose that radio galaxies are an important diagnostic of Myr timescale AGN fuelling, due to their `long-term memory'.",James Matthews,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,False,15:00,15:15,Monday,,,,,,
AGN on the Beach of X-ray Polarimetry,"X-ray polarimetry is a crucial diagnostic tool to investigate the disk-corona scattering geometry in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the particle acceleration mechanisms in AGN jets. However, only recently, thanks to the sensitivity of the detectors on board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), it became possible to perform X-ray polarimetric measurements of extragalactic sources. In this talk, we will summarize the remarkable discoveries achieved thanks to the new window of X-ray polarimetry, with a focus on the geometry in the disk, wind, and torus in radio-quiet AGN, as well as the acceleration mechanisms in relativistic jets from radio-loud AGN. In particular, we will present the results of recent IXPE observations of NGC 4151 (a prototypical Seyfert 1) and Mrk 421 (a prototypical blazar). Finally, we will discuss future perspectives for a deeper understanding of the geometrical and dynamical properties of AGN.",Dawoon Edwin Kim,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,False,15:15,15:30,Monday,,,,,,

Spectacular 240 kpc double-sided relativistic jets in a spiral- hosted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy,"Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a sub-class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their narrow permitted lines can be explained with a low gas velocity around a low-mass black hole (BH). Some authors, instead, proposed that the low BH mass is due to an inclination effect.  Studying host galaxy morphologies can be useful to disentangle these two scenarios. Moreover, NLS1s have demonstrated that the presence of radio jets in an AGN is governed by other factors than those previously believed. To this aim, I worked on radio and NIR/optical properties of a remarkable NLS1, J0354-1340. From the VLA observations, I found that the source shows very extended radio jets, the largest found to date in an NLS1. The high spectral index of the extended emission is due to the interaction between the extended jets and the ICM, which re-accelerates the electrons in the lobe. By means of photometric decomposition and colour maps, I found this NLS1 hosted by a disc-like galaxy, probably with pseudobulges. My results confirm that powerful jets can also be launched and sustained by less massive BHs in spiral galaxies dominated by secular processes and not only by elliptical galaxies hosting the massive BHs and experiencing merger events.",Amelia Vietri,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,True,16:00,16:15,Monday,,,,,,
The CosmoDRAGoN simulations: dynamics and radio observables for AGN jets in realistic environments,"Observable properties of AGN jets and jet-inflated structures are highly dependent on the properties of both the jets and their environments. I will present the first results from the CosmoDRAGoN project (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10059.pdf), the largest suite of 3D relativistic jet simulations in realistic environments to date. We inject conical jets into re-gridded SPH outputs of groups and clusters from cosmological galaxy formation simulations, simulating the active and remnant phases of the AGN lifecycle. By combining grid and particle-based methods with analytical post-processing, we calculate synchrotron emission for our simulated sources, capturing particle acceleration and loss processes across a wide range of jet ([non-]relativistic speeds, opening angles) and environment (mass, redshift) parameters. Our simulations reproduce FR-I and FR-II morphologies and make detailed predictions for resolved radio spectra. I will discuss how intrinsic AGN properties relate to observable emission and the implications for population studies of radio AGN and AGN feedback. I will also discuss recent work extending CosmoDRAGoN to predict the full Stokes parameters and present results of using Faraday rotation to probe AGN environments.",Larissa Jerrim,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,False,16:15,16:30,Monday,,,,,,
The X-ray obscuration and the origin of the high-energy emission in young radio sources,"The early jet-ISM feedback can be  studied in depth in Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs), which have the radio lobe emission on both sides of an active nucleus and the projected radio size LS < 1 kpc. We present the radio-to-gamma-ray SED modeling of four CSOs, which are among the nearest (z < 0.2) and youngest (age < 450 yr) CSOs known to date: PKS 1718-649, a gamma-ray loud and X-ray unobscured source, and three gamma-ray quiet CSOs with X-ray absorption NH > 10^23 cm^-2. The extent of their radio lobes, LS < 25 pc, is comparable with that of the obscuring tori observed with ALMA in a number of AGN. We show that in the framework of the expanding radio lobe model, the mix of the Inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the IR and UV photons off the ultra-relativistic lobe electrons is able to account for the gross of the CSO X-ray emission. We report on a correlation between the radio slope and X-ray NH, which explains the gamma-ray quietness of the CSOs with high NH. Conversely, the gamma-rays detected with Fermi/LAT from PKS 1718-649 can be modeled well with the IC scattering of the UV photons. Our results indicate an intriguing interplay between the central ISM and the properties of the young radio lobe electrons.",Malgosia Sobolewska,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,False,16:30,16:45,Monday,,,,,,
The z=6.18 radio quasar CFHQS J142952+544717 under Chandra X-ray lens,"The search for jetted quasars at high redshift (z>5-6) is an active field with ground-breaking discoveries following each other. The existence of these objects is in fact a challenge for model of structure formation, as their radio power requires a very massive black hole, and represents an unique opportunity to investigate the formation and expansion of jets at cosmic dawn. Among the few known radio-loud quasars at z>6, CFHQS J142952+544717 is characterised by a moderate radio-loudness and an extremely high X-ray luminosity (>10^46 erg/s), as reported by eROSITA and XMM-Newton observations. VLBI observations showed a compact (<100 pc) but marginally resolved morphology and a brightness temperature (T_B~10^9 K) that  does not support an aligned jet, hence disfavouring Doppler boosting as the reason of the high X-ray luminosity, and possibly pointing to an initial stage of its radio activity. Here, we present the results of a ~30 ksec Chandra observation that allowed us to perform the first X-ray study of J1429 at sub-arcsecond resolution.",Giulia Migliori,Contributed,Jet formation and physics,False,16:45,17:00,Monday,,,,,,

Jet-feedback on kpc scales: a review,"Relativistic jets from AGNs are an important driver of feedback in galaxies with an active black hole. They impact the nearby environment over different physical scales during their lifetime, with varying effects. Although the impact of such jets have primarily been considered in the context of heating the large scale environment, recent series of works over the last decade, both in observations and theory, have focused on their immediate impact on the host galaxy itself. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well its star formation.  However, to what extent such feedback are efficient in impacting the large scale gas in the galaxy is still a question of debate. I will review the results in this context both from observations and theoretical simulations, and discuss the potential caveats and open questions.

"Modelling observational aspects of jet feedback: ionization, emission, kinematics and polarization","Jet driven feedback has been predicted to be an important contributor to the host galaxy’s evolution. However, both qualitative and quantitative constraints on such activity are lacking due to absence of spatially resolved simulations and predictions regarding observable features. To bridge this gap, we have started a series of works to predict observable features expected from high resolution simulations of relativistic jets interacting with their environment. In Meenakshi et al. (2022a,b) we attempted to explore the extent of ionization, and emission and kinematics from the shocked gas. We found that the shocks from the jets can ionize a significant fraction of dense gas in the disc as well as clear out the central region, allowing AGN radiation to travel farther. The jets produce large-scale outflows, creating high-velocity dispersion and disrupted symmetry in the projected velocity fields. We have also performed RMHD simulations of jets interacting with a magnetized ambient medium. We find that the forward shock of the jet compresses and amplifies the magnetic field, and the random polarity of the magnetic fields in the shocked ambient medium lead to depolarization of the synchrotron radiation produced in the jet.",Meenakshi Moun ,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,09:30,09:45,Tuesday,,,,,,
The ALMA view of the gas cycle in nearby AGN,"High-resolution (<10-100pc) images of the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the central disks of nearby AGN are key to deciphering the mechanisms regulating the gas cycle of nuclear activity in galaxies. These observations are now accessible for an increasing number of targets thanks to the advent of ALMA.  We describe how detailed studies conducted by our group have underlined the potential role of radio jets in launching molecular outflows in a number of AGN (NGC1068, NGC5643, NGC5506, NGC2110 & NGC613). We have also searched for the imprint left by AGN feedback on the radial distribution of molecular gas using ALMA images from >70 close AGN in 3 CO lines obtained by the NUGA, GATOS, WISDOM and LLAMA projects. Using different prescriptions for the distribution of molecular gas  we find enhanced nuclear-scale molecular gas deficits in the most extreme AGN. We detect molecular outflows in the sources showing the most extreme nuclear-scale gas deficits. This suggests that AGN feedback can be caught at work more frequently  in higher luminosity or higher Eddington ratio sources. We explore avenues to validate this evolutionary scenario using numerical simulations of the feeding and feedback cycle in galaxy disks.

Kinetic outflow of Low Luminosity AGN: the PARSEC view,"Low luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) represent the vast majority of the AGN population in the near universe. Their relatively large BH masses and low luminosity place them in the very low Eddington ratio regime, and still, despite their low radiative significance, their main main channel for release of energy is thought to be mechanical via  their jets.  
I will show that parsec-scale observations across the electromagnetic spectrum of some of the nearest low Eddington cases reveal their spectral energy distribution to be fundamentally   dominated by jet emission  over circa  ten order of magnitude in frequency. Moreover,  some of these nuclei show a highly ionised spectrum of coronal lines in the IR. When resolution permits,  this emission show extended and collimated over parsec scales in the jet direction.  I will discuss  how these lines become  genuine tracers of  the  mechanical power dumped by the jet into the medium. On the basis of the energetics so far estimated, the  net balance between  radiative  and mechanical power in these sources will be presented.",Almudena Prieto,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,10:00,10:15,Tuesday,,,,,,

Evidence of Jet induced shocked ionized outflow at pc scale,"AGN can have an impact on their host galaxy via radiation, outflows and relativistic jets from them by their capability to heat, compress and/or remove gas, at different scales. On an observational perspective, the impact of AGN on their host galaxies is a matter of debate. To understand the complex connection between AGN and the ISM of their hosts at small scale, we present the studies of one nearby AGN host galxay, NGC4395. NGC4395 hosts a IMBH, having mass 10^4 - 10^5 M_sun and situtated at a distance of ~4.5 Mpc. Using optical IFU data from GMOS, we found the presence of ionized outflowing gas, co-spatial with resolved radio jet like structure at 15 GHz at 10 pc scale. The asymmetry in the ionized [OIII] line and the high velocity dispersion indicates that the medium is kinematically disturbed. Using CLOUDY and MAPPING III model, we found the ionization is to be due to shocks. The power of the jet is ~10^39 erg/s which is higher than the power of ionized outflowing gas (~4x10^36 erg/s). From Gemini-NIFS and ALMA data, we found a spatial offset of cold molecular gas (CO 2-1) relative to nuclear hot molecular gas (H2 2.408 um) favouring a scenario of the AGN inhibiting star formation on 10 pc scale.",Payel Nandi,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),True,11:25,11:40,Tuesday,,,,,,
Jet-ISM interaction revealed by JWST/MIRI spectroscopy,"The mid-IR range contains a unique set of spectral features (rotational H2 transitions, ionized gas tracers, and coronal lines) that are key to quantify the impact of radio jets on the dusty circum-nuclear ISM. For the first time, JWST mid-IR spectroscopy can spatially and spectrally resolve the jet-ISM interaction in nearby galaxies enabling new insights into this phenomenon.

I will present the initial analysis of the mid-IR data obtained for NGC 7319 (Sy2 AGN in the Stephan's Quintet) as part of the JWST Early Release Observations, as well as other AGN observed by Early Release Science and Cycle 1 programs.
Warm/hot molecular H2 and ionized gas emission is detected at the radio hotspots while extended coronal emission ([Mg V], [Ne VI] and [Ne V]) is seen close to the jet axis for some objects.
The mechanical energy in these gas phases at the radio hotspots seems to be small (<1%) compared to the jet energy and it is well below the expectations from relativistic jet simulations. I will present possible scenarios to explain this result which is apparently at odds with the predictions of theoretical models.",Miguel Pereira-Santaella,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,11:40,11:55,Tuesday,,,,,,
Elucidating the impact of galaxy substructure on black hole growth and AGN feedback,"We still have major gaps in our understanding of the role of AGN feedback in driving galaxy evolution and self-regulating black hole growth. We routinely find observational signatures of outflows, and we know that this material can entrain or heat gas along the way but mysteries remain regarding their actual impact on the host galaxy. I will present a detailed case study of nearby active galaxy NGC7582 for which we found an important role played by galaxy substructure (600pc ring) in collimating the AGN outflows and also containing a radio jet with low inclination w.r.t. the main galaxy disk, thereby shielding the host galaxy from both forms of AGN feedback (winds and jet). This analysis was based on high quality 3D spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE spanning 8 kpc across for NGC 7582. We mapped the stellar and gas kinematics, ionized gas properties, and radio continuum, clearly distinguishing between the rotating galactic disk and the AGN-photoionized outflow. We augment the analysis with ALMA data that revealed a molecular torus and a ring. While such detailed analyses are only feasible for nearby galaxies, they give us a preview of technical feats that we will achieve at higher redshifts with JWST or with the large aperture telescopes.",Stéphanie Juneau,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,11:55,12:10,Tuesday,,,,,,
Quasar winds modify the distribution of cold molecular gas and young stellar populations in the central kiloparsec of galaxies,"Different modes of AGN feedback are now considered key processes in the evolution of massive galaxies by regulating black hole and galaxy growth. Indeed, a wealth of observational evidence demonstrates that feedback from supermassive black holes impacts the galaxies and the halos they inhabit on a wide range of scales: from the central parsecs to hundreds of kpc. What we are still far from understanding is how AGN feedback couples with the host galaxy, which is what ultimately determines its efficiency. The aim of our project is to answer this question by quantifying the impact of multi-phase quasar-driven outflows and jets on the nuclear regions of galaxies, which have the same dynamical timescales as AGN activity and the outflows and jets that it drives. I will present recent results based on high angular resolution data from cutting-edge telescopes including Keck, Gemini, and ALMA. We do not find evidence for a significant impact of quasar-driven winds/jets on the total molecular gas reservoirs and star formation rates, but they are undoubtedly modifying the distribution of cold molecular gas and young stellar populations (ages < 100 Myr) in the central kpc of the galaxies.

Extended forbidden high-ionisation gas as a signature of jet-driven outflows in AGN,"The kinetic channel is usually regarded as the dominant feedback process in radio-galaxies. However, its effect in radio-weak AGN (RWAGN) is still uncertain and poorly assessed. In this context, we study the kinetic feedback in 7 bona-fide RWAGN by means of the high-ionisation gas (HIG) and MUSE spectroscopy. We found that the [FeVII] 608.7 nm, the [FeX] 637.4 nm, and the [SiVI] 1963 nm emission suitably traces that feedback component. In all cases the HIG is strongly aligned to the radio-jet and the X-ray emission, extending to scales of 2−3 kpc from the centre. Moreover, the gas kinematics is highly perturbed, decoupled from galaxy rotation, with velocities reaching ∼800 km/s relative to the systemic velocity at locations as far as 1 kpc from the AGN. Models combining the effects of both photoionization by central source and shocks support the scenario where the HIG is essentially shock-driven, most likely by the radio jet. We show that the detection of extended HIG unambiguously probes the presence of the kinetic channel in RWAGN, with outflow rates as large as those measured in radio-galaxies.  Moreover,  it can be used to measure the kinematics of the thermal X-ray emitting gas because of the interval in IP it covers.

Feedback on ionised gas over the radio AGN life-cycle,"Jet driven gas outflows have been observed in radio loud AGN, and radio AGN are also known to have a life-cycle of activity. However it is still not completely clear how feedback evolves with the AGN life-cycle. In the first part of my talk, I will discuss our results from a study to investigate this with a sample of uniformly selected 129 radio AGN up to z=0.2 and L(1.4 GHz)=1e26 W/Hz. We used radio spectral shape from 144-3000 MHz (LoTSS, FIRST, VLASS) as a proxy for the evolutionary stage of the AGN, and [OIII] spectra to trace the warm ionised gas kinematics. We found that outflows in young sources (peaked radio spectrum) were more extreme than evolved sources (non-peaked), and are typically short lived. This was true even if we included the [OIII] non-detections and used a stacking analysis, showing this is true on average for the radio AGN population. For candidate restarted AGN, we found tentative evidence for more disturbed gas kinematics, suggesting a link with episodic jet activity. In the second part, I will discuss new results from an expansion of this study to ~5500 sources, up to z=0.8 and L(1.4 GHz)=1e28 W/Hz. Our findings support the picture from simulations where impact of feedback changes as the radio jets grow.",Pranav Kukreti,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,12:40,12:55,Tuesday,,,,,,
Signatures of jet-cloud interaction in radio-loud AGNs from MALS Data Release I (DR1) sample,"Cold gas viz. atomic and molecular hydrogen forms the dominant fraction of known AGN driven outflows as well as fuels both star-formation and AGN activity. The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS; https://mals.iucaa.in/) aims to provide a dust-unbiased census of kinematics and distribution of cold gas associated with radio-loud AGNs up-to a redshift of 1.5, where steep evolution in AGN activity takes place. MALS has observed nearly a million radio sources using MeerKAT's L- and UHF-bands, with continuum and spectral line sensitivities of ~20 microJy/b and ~0.5 mJy/b per 6 km/s channel, respectively. I’ll discuss the continuum catalogs from the survey, sources from which are being searched for HI 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorptions (tracers for cold gas). Combining wideband SEDs from MALS with multi-wavelength data, we aim to characterize the host-galaxy/AGN properties, enabling studies of various correlations between jet power, jet age etc., with properties of the outflowing gas. The large sample of associated absorbers from the survey will probe multiple scenarios of jet-cloud interaction.

Jet-ISM interaction on galactic scales (positive vs negative feedback,"Understanding the physical processes that connect Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to their host galaxies remains an ongoing challenge of extragalactic astrophysics. On the one hand, it is well established that powerful jets can regulate cooling of galactic halo gas, at least in the densest environments. However, there is now a plethora of observational evidence that jets, of all powers, can influence their host galaxies and larger environments in multiple ways. This includes: (1) increased turbulence in the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM); (2) induced shocks/excitation in ionised and molecular ISM; (3) removal of ISM gas in outflows; (4) interaction between radio lobes and molecular gas on circumgalactic scales. In addition to these negative `feedback’ effects, there is evidence for localised jet-induced star formation in some targets. This jet-induced processes appear to also be important in radiatively dominant (‘radio quiet’) AGN, which can be missed without sensitive radio observations. In this review talk I will give a brief overview of these types of observations and use this to introduce the more detailed talks on specific observational campaigns.",Chris Harrison,Invited,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),True,14:30,15:00,Tuesday,,,,,,
How do outflows from the AGN affect the star formation activity inside the host galaxy?,"Outflows from AGN are believed to have a profound effect on the evolution of the host galaxy. The local input of the energy by the outflow into the ISM of the host galaxy can alter the physical state of the gas and regulate the star formation activity. We apply a turbulence-regulated model of star formation (published in Mandal et al. 2021) to explore how different processes, such as turbulence, gravity, and cooling affect the evolution of the dense star-forming gas being impacted by AGN-driven outflows. We apply this model to both galactic scale simulations of AGN jet-disk interaction as well as resolved simulations of collision between the outflows and individual star-forming clouds. The latter studies employ a newly developed Poisson solver in the PLUTO code to probe the impact of the self-gravity of dense clouds. We find that the shock from the outflow can induce turbulence inside the gas leading to reduced star formation. Also, the radiative shocks can compress the gas to a very high density making the cloud more prone to become gravitationally unstable to form stars. We also find that such systems can go through different evolutionary phases depending on the degree and strength of the interaction.",Ankush Mandal,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,15:00,15:15,Tuesday,,,,,,
Jet-driven star formation in kpc-scale infant radio sources,"We present the first systematic study of jet-induced star formation in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. The powerful galaxy-sized radio sources hosted in CSS galaxies are the infancy stage of radio galaxy evolution, and hence, crucial in understanding the radio-mode AGN feedback. Radio source driven starbursts only have observational evidence in older, large-scale radio galaxies so far, and are predicted for compact radio sources in theoretical simulations. Using UV continuum as a direct diagnostic for massive young stellar population, we detected extended UV continuum emitting regions in Hubble imaging of six nearby (z < 0.6) CSS host galaxies. Likely to be star forming regions, these UV knots are found spatially aligned along radio jet structure, which suggests jet-induced star formation. Age estimations with stellar population synthesis shows the observations are consistent with star forming activity triggered by the current or an earlier episode of radio emission. Our findings are a strong candidate for positive AGN feedback in compact radio galaxies.",Chetna Duggal,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,15:15,15:30,Tuesday,,,,,,
The importance of kpc-scale jet-induced outflows in local radio-intermediate AGN,"Outflows driven by AGN are now thought to be an important form of feedback, with statistical studies providing evidence for them being particularly powerful in galaxies with intermediate radio luminosities. While observations of the NLRs of such galaxies have revealed outflows on kpc scales and in a range of gas phases, their true impact remains unclear. Principally, this is because electron densities of the warm ionised phase (T>10,000K) are often underestimated, leading to outflow kinetic powers being overestimated. Furthermore, outflow acceleration mechanisms are ambiguous in many cases. In this talk, I will present the results of detailed studies of a small sample of nearby Seyfert galaxies that address these issues. In all cases, we find evidence for the NLR outflows being accelerated via shocks induced by jet-ISM interactions, despite the outflowing gas having ionisation conditions that are consistent with AGN-photoionisation. Moreover, using robust density diagnostics for the warm ionised phase, we find densities that are orders of magnitude above those commonly found, and thus derive much lower mass outflow rates. Overall, my talk will highlight the diverse conditions of jet-driven outflows on kpc-scales in local galaxies.",Luke Holden,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,15:30,15:45,Tuesday,,,,,,
Jet-induced molecular gas excitation and turbulence in the Teacup,"Jets launched by supermassive black holes are one of the potential drivers of multi-phase outflows and can alter the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies on (sub-)kpc scales. In order to investigate the impact of radio jets on the cold gas reservoirs of AGN, we present ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of the Teacup galaxy. This is a radio-quiet type-2 quasar with a compact low-power radio jet that subtends a small angle from the molecular gas disc. Enhanced emission line widths perpendicular to the jet orientation have been reported for several nearby AGN for the ionised gas. For the molecular gas in the Teacup, not only do we find this enhancement in the velocity dispersion but also a higher brightness temperature ratio (T32/T21) perpendicular to the radio jet compared to the ratios found in the galaxy disc. Our results and the comparison with simulations suggest that the radio jet is compressing and accelerating the molecular gas, and driving a lateral outflow that shows enhanced velocity dispersion and higher gas excitation. These results provide further evidence that the coupling between the jet and the ISM is relevant to AGN feedback even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies.",Anelise Audibert,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),False,15:45,16:00,Tuesday,,,,,,

"AGN feedback from compact, low-power jets and galactic ionised outflows in the Teacup QSO: Properties, interplay and effects","The low-z Teacup QSO is a great laboratory to study in detail the complex interplay between SMBH, radio jets, ISM and CGM. It hosts a compact (~1 kpc) jet, ~10 kpc radio and optical AGN-driven bubbles, and both ionised and molecular outflows. 
By employing new VLT/MUSE observations, we detect large gas velocity dispersions perpendicular to the compact jet, indicating that this strongly perturbs the host ISM, as recently found in other jetted sources. In line with recent work and simulations, this demonstrates that compact (<1 kpc), low-power (<10^44 erg/s) jets can significantly affect their hosts.
Moreover, we find an exceptionally powerful galactic ionised outflow, and dissect its properties (mass, kinematics, energetics) from ~1 to 10s kpc scales. We determine its driver among jet and AGN radiation, and compare with model predictions. While the outflow efficiently depletes the reservoir for star formation (“negative” feedback), little material can eventually escape the DM halo. The expelled gas might thus be re-accreted on the galaxy at later times.
Finally, we find evidence for stars formed around the 10 kpc expanding bubble due to the compression by jet and outflow (“positive” feedback), as predicted by theory.",Giacomo Venturi,Contributed,Feedback (circumnuclear and galactic scales),True,16:30,16:45,Tuesday,,,,,,
The impact of AGN activity in nearby Seyfert galaxies: high resolution study of the multiphase ISM,"I will discuss the physics of the multiphase gas in local active galaxies and the impact of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) on the host galaxy evolution.

I will focus on the warm ionized, cold molecular phases and radio properties, using MUSE/VLT, ALMA and VLA data. 
I will present a detailed dynamical modelling of the gas component through which we can reconstruct the distribution and kinematics of the discs, winds, jets and their interaction.
By exploiting spatially resolved MUSE multi-line diagnostics, we are able to derive the best estimate of the velocity field, spatial distribution, and electron density, therefore properly quantify the ionized mass and outflow energetics. By comparing high resolution radio and sub-mm data of the central region we are able to infer the presence of compact radio-jets, star formation activity and dust emission on sub-kpc scales.

In this project, we are combining optical integral-field spectroscopy data from the MaNGA survey and sensitive radio observations with Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) to measure the properties of both components with comparable (~1-2”) angular resolution. In this talk, we will present a joint analysis of the radio morphology and spectrum, ionized gas kinematics, and the properties of the host galaxy for our sample of galaxies in conjunction with results concern the pc-scale radio emission of these AGN derived from VLBI observations.

What have we learned about the life-cycle of radio AGN ,"The recurrent activity of radio AGN, with phases of activity alternating to periods of quiescence, has been known since the early studies of these objects. However, the full relevance of this cycle has been only emphasised in the past years by the requirement, from   the AGN feedback scenario, of a recurrent impact of the energy released by the SMBH during the lifetime of the host galaxy: only in this way AGN feedback can influence galaxy evolution.  Timing the duty-cycle of radio AGN offers the possibility not only to quantify this impact but also to connect it with their evolutionary stage.  
Radio AGN in different evolutionary phases can be identified by their properties, like morphology and spectral indices. However, building large enough samples of radio sources in the most elusive phases of their evolution, like dying and restarted objects, has been always challenging. Only by characterising these phases, the full duty cycle can be quantified.
The availability of the new, large surveys and, in particular, the one at low frequencies, together with the development of new numerical simulations, makes this task now possible. Indeed, the past years have brought particularly exciting results in this field.

Using AGN incidences to probe properties of jet powering with eROSITA and LOFAR,"The eROSITA eFEDS survey reaches an unprecedented combination of X-ray sensitivity and sky coverage, additionally being enhanced by many multiwavelength surveys. This project investigates how radio- and X-ray-selected SMBHs populate galaxies. We use the highly complete GAMA09 survey to measure the fraction of galaxies hosting AGN, defined using LOFAR and eROSITA data. We find that the incidence of radio AGN with compact morphologies as a function of 'radio luminosity/stellar mass' results in more massive galaxies being more likely to host radio AGN. Yet, when recasting this as a function of 'jet power/Eddington luminosity' (i.e. specific black hole kinetic power), low and high mass show consistent trends, indicating a possible mass-invariant jet powering mechanism, much like the universal triggering/fueling mechanisms found here and in past X-ray work. The fraction of quiescent vs. star forming galaxies hosting radio AGN is also comparable, defying the view that only red and dead galaxies host radio AGN. Lastly, the impact of environment on jet powering is probed by including radio AGN with complex morphologies (e.g. FRII).

A Multi-frequency Analysis of the Timescales Associated with AGN Activity in a Jetted Green Bean Galaxy,"Jetted AGN that host extended ionized nebulae provide us with a unique view of the timescales associated with AGN activity. Here we present a multi-frequency analysis of one such source caught in a moment where the properties of the central engine have changed. Specifically, we use radio observations to constrain the time since the last reacceleration of charged particles in the radio galaxy hotspots of the system, and optical long-slit spectroscopy to estimate the redshift and kinematic properties of the host galaxy, and the light travel time needed to ionize the extended gas around the AGN. The data suggest that the AGN was previously in a low accretion state associated with the production of radio jets, but has since transitioned to a state of higher accretion associated with ionizing the extended gas around it. We discuss the possibilities that the AGN underwent this transition either via AGN flickering, or via an accretion state transition as seen in Galactic X-ray binaries. We also discuss possible explanations for the unusual apparent hybrid radio morphology of the source, including the presence of a detached cloud coincident with one of the radio hot spots in the circum-galactic medium of the system.",Kelly Sanderson,Contributed,Duty cycle ,False,11:35,11:50,Wednesday,,,,,,
Radio observations of nearby X-ray and optically bright giant elliptical galaxies and their interaction with the intergalactic medium,"Many massive early-type galaxies host central radio sources and hot X-ray atmospheres indicating the presence of radio-mechanical AGN feedback. The duty cycle and detailed physics of the radio-mode AGN feedback is still a matter of debate. To address these questions, we analyzed 1-2 GHz JVLA radio observations of a sample of the 42 nearest optically and X-ray brightest early-type galaxies. We detect radio emission in 41/42 galaxies. Furthermore, 27/42 galaxies in our sample host extended radio structures and 34/42 sources show environmental interactions in the form of X-ray cavities. We find a significant correlation between the radio flux density and the largest linear size of the radio emission and between the radio power and the luminosity of the central X-ray point-source. The central radio spectral indices of the galaxies span a wide range of values, with the majority of the systems having steep spectra and the rest flat spectra. These results are consistent with AGN activity, where the central radio sources are mostly switched on, thus the duty cycle is very high. For the future, we plan to investigate the cold gas content in our sample with ALMA, to understand in more depth the feeding process of the central engine.",Romana Grossova,Contributed,Duty cycle ,False,11:50,12:05,Wednesday,,,,,,
Constraining the AGN duty cycle in the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421,"The galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 hosts one of the most powerful jetted AGN known.
The radio plasma ejected from the central AGN has displaced the intra-cluster medium, leaving two pairs of X-ray cavities, associated with different outbursts, and a weak shock front.
In this talk, I will present new LOFAR observations, which high sensitivity and resolution (up to sub-arcsec resolution with international baselines), allowed to study this source in great details. At LOFAR frequency (144 MHz) the outer radio lobes are wider, perfectly filling the X-ray cavities. An intermediate lobe and its associated X-ray cavity were discovered, indicating the presence of a further phase of jet activity. Combining multi-frequency radio data and X-ray data, the duty cycle of the source and the AGN feedback were investigated. The radio spectra of the lobes is very steep even at 144 MHz, indicating the presence of old particles. In three phases of jet activity, the AGN was active for most of the time with only brief quiescent phases that ensured the repeated heating of the central gas.

The demographics of radio-AGN activity from LoTSS and SDSS,"The combination of the vast, high-sensitivity radio catalogues being produced by the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), with the large spectroscopic samples made available through SDSS, provides a remarkable resource to understand the triggering, evolution and feedback effects of radio-AGN in the nearby Universe. Using these data, we confirm the existence of the tight fundamental plane of black hole activity (jet power vs accretion power vs black hole mass) using tens of thousands of local AGN, and characterise the additional galaxy parameters that produce the scatter in the relation. We also measure the prevalence of different classes of radio-AGN activity as multi-variate functions of stellar mass, black hole mass, environment and galaxy morphology. Once the strong stellar mass dependence is accounted for, we find no dependence of radio-AGN activity on either black hole mass or morphology, but do find enhanced radio luminosities in higher density environments. These results imply that the triggering of radio-AGN activity is controlled by processes on galactic scales or larger. We discuss the implications of this result for radio-AGN fuelling and the radio-AGN feedback cycle.",Philip Best,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,12:20,12:35,Wednesday,,,,,,

Galaxy groups as the ultimate probe of AGN feedback,"The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting AGN with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. I will review our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. I will then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups.

Inefficient jet-induced star formation in Centaurus A: Can shocks regulate star formation in the northern filaments?,"The influence of AGN and radio jets on galaxy evolution remains poorly understood. While AGN feedback is often invoked as a regulation mechanism for star formation, some radio galaxies show evidence of recent star formation along their radio jet. This suggests that the jets can drive positive feedback.

   Located at 3.8 Mpc, Centaurus A is a testbed to study the so-called ”jet-induced star formation” in its northern filaments, at the interaction of the jet with a HI shell. Although the molecular gas reservoir is important, star formation is very inefficient as compared to disc-like environments. This suggests that the energy injected by the jet acts positively in the formation of molecular gas from the HI shell, but is too strong for star formation to be efficient.

   MUSE observations revealed that the optical emission associated with the filaments is likely excited by shocks. I will thus present the results of our study of the shock properties at the scale of the molecular clouds. This analysis is based on a multi-wavelength campaign: (1) various molecular lines with APEX and ALMA, (2) the ionised gas with MUSE, and (3) KMOS observations of the warm H2 at 2.12 microns.",Quentin Salomé,Contributed,Feedback (large scales and clusters),False,10:00,10:15,Thursday,,,,,,

I will discuss the different feeding/feedback features found, which make it a prime example of the interplay between multiphase gas haloes and radio jets. Lastly, I will present our preliminary results on the optical-to-X-ray comparison of a sample of 3CR radio galaxies. Apart from showcasing the morphological link between their extended X-ray and optical emission, sources with the same excitation state also display approximately constant X-ray to optical flux ratios.

Investigating how feedback is onset: young radio galaxies at the center of cool core clusters,"The investigation of the AGN feedback cycle in galaxy clusters has historically been performed for systems where feedback is ongoing (""mature-feedback"" systems), that is where the central jetted AGN has inflated radio lobes, pushing aside the intracluster medium (ICM). However, measuring the ICM cooling properties in systems where the gas has already been perturbed by the central activity cannot reveal the conditions that onset feedback. A potential workaround is to investigate systems that are right around the point of triggering feedback, as soon after the AGN begins its activity as possible. This talk is dedicated to recent results on two ""pre-feedback"" clusters, which harbor newly born radio galaxies (<10^4 yr), too young to have affected their cool cores. Chandra observations of these two systems unveiled an as-yet unheated ICM, whose entropy and cooling time within 20 kpc from the center fall below those of ""mature-feedback"" clusters by a factor ∼2. Conversely, MUSE data revealed that the properties of the gas at ∼10^4 K seem to remain invariant between the two feedback stages.

Losing the feedback-feeding loop of the radio galaxy 3C 84,"Gas accretion by a galaxy's super massive black hole (SMBH) and the energetic
feedback by the accreting active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the gas around it

shown how plasma jets emitted by the AGN heat the intracluster medium,
preventing cooling of the cluster gas and thus the infall of this gas onto the

inflated by the jets, instead also induce local cooling of the cluster gas,
leading to filaments of cold gas. The fate of these filaments is unclear, but
it has been suggested they may feed the AGN activity. We present results

LOFAR unveils an exceptional radio lobe-spiral galaxy encounter,"I will report on the serendipitous discovery of an unprecedented interaction between the radio lobe of an FRI galaxy and a spiral galaxy.

The new low-frequency observation revealed that one of the radio lobes of the central galaxy GIN 049 encompasses the spiral galaxy JO36 (z=0.0407). Previous studies carried out with MUSE revealed that the hot, ionized interstellar medium of JO36, traced by Hα emission, is severely truncated with respect to its stellar disk.  We further explore this unique system by including new uGMRT observations at 610 MHz to map the spectral index all over the radio source. I will showcase the results of this multi-wavelength analysis. The emerging scenario is that the evolution of JO36 has been strongly driven by a combination of environmental processing, via the ram pressure stripping, and the encounter with the radio lobe. In turn, the galaxy passage left a trace in the radio-old lobe by re-accelerating the old relativistic electrons.

In this talk, I will present results of recent highly sensitive observations at low-frequency performed with LOFAR and the uGMRT of AGN living in dense environments that show evidence of ongoing interaction with the thermal gas, as confirmed by X-ray observations. I will also provide evidence for the presence of filaments of radio emission with very steep spectrum which are likely related to remnant fossil plasma ejected by previous AGN outbursts that is being re-energized through compression processes.

AGN feedback in galaxy groups: radio surveys insights on the lower-mass regime,"In the last two decades, significant improvement has been made in the understanding of how radio-mode AGN feedback operates in galaxy clusters. However, the vast majority of these studies involved observations of relatively small, high-mass (M> 5 x 10^14 Msun) samples. I will review recent advances in the lower-mass regime, where survey observations performed by VLA, LOFAR and MeerKAT in the radio band, in combination with eROSITA, Chandra and XMM-Newton in the X-rays, are exploited to investigate AGN feedback on the macro scale in large (N>200) samples of galaxy clusters and groups, for the first time down to masses of 2 x 10^13 Msun. A correlation exists between the cluster X-ray emission and the radio emission of the central AGN, which seemingly holds at all masses for both disturbed and relaxed objects. Brightest Cluster Galaxies hosting strong AGN radio emission are always found within 0.2 virial radii from the cluster centre, and there is evidence for an higher probability of stronger AGN being hosted in more massive systems.

The J1030 field: AGN feedback in a young proto-cluster at z = 1.7 and in faint radio-galaxy populations,"In this talks I will report on interferometric observations of the so-called ""J1030"" field centered around the z = 6.3 SDSS Quasar J1030+0524, carried out with ALMA and JVLA. This field hosts a LSS assembling around a powerful HzRG at z = 1.7 that shows evidence of positive AGN feedback in heating the surrounding ICM and promoting star-formation in multiple galaxies at hundreds kpc distances. I report the detection of gas-rich members of the LSS, show that the LSS is going to evolve into a local massive cluster and that the HzRG is the proto-BCG. I will show signatures of the proto-BCG's interaction with the surrounding ICM, strengthening the positive AGN feedback scenario. From the JVLA observations of the ""J1030"" field we extracted one of the deepest extra-galactic radio surveys to date (~12.5 uJy at 5 sigma). Exploiting the synergy with the X-ray deep survey (~500 ks) we investigated the relation of the X-ray/radio emission of a X-ray-selected sample, unveiling that the radio emission is powered by different processes (star-formation and AGN). AGN-driven sample is mostly composed by RQ objects that display a significant X-ray/radio correlation, possibly indicating the presence of jet-induced feedback in RQ AGN.",Quirino D'Amato,Contributed,Feedback (large scales and clusters),False,12:45,13:00,Thursday,,,,,,

 Jet-induced feedback on circumgalactic and extragalactic scales: a theoretical perspective,"Radio jets launched by supermassive black holes offer perhaps the most obvious evidence of active galactic nucleus feedback in action. Understanding the interplay between jets and their environments is crucial for unravelling how supermassive black holes can influence the evolution of galaxies, groups, and clusters. Advancements in simulation and numerical techniques over the past decade or so have allowed us to model jet feedback on a wide range of scales and in evermore intricate detail. This review focuses on what we can learn from simulations of jet feedback acting on the circumgalactic medium and beyond. I will outline the simulation methods employed for studying jets on these scales and highlight the challenges faced in doing so. While I will briefly discuss the influence of jets on the circumgalactic medium, my primary focus will be on insights gained from simulating jet feedback in group and cluster environments. Specifically, I will provide an overview of several key topics. Firstly, how jet properties, including cosmic ray content, affect the inflation and evolution of lobes. Secondly, what simulations tell us about how the jet energy couples to the surrounding medium. Thirdly, and likely in combination with the above points, I will attempt to outline recent progress in understanding the impact that various physical processes and phenomena, such as cluster weather, magnetic fields, thermal conduction and viscosity, have in determining the nature and effectiveness of this feedback mechanism. Finally, I will outline key open questions and highlight promising avenues for future investigation.",Martin Bourne ,Invited,Feedback (large scales and clusters),True,14:30,15:00,Thursday,,,,,,
What can bent-jet radio galaxies teach us about their environment?,"The recent advances in sensitivity of radio-frequency facilities have revealed complex structures in many bent-jet radio galaxies which complicates their classification. The nearby Perseus cluster is an astonishing case study for such sources. High sensitivity, high resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations have resolved new structures associated with several bent-jet radio galaxies harbored within this cluster, including IC310 - the only known tailed radio galaxy with a gamma-ray counterpart. I will present different interpretations of their morphologies, involving interaction with bulk motions of intracluster gas and the galaxy’s orbit in the cluster. Such work is paving the way for the SKA surveys, which should detect roughly one million bent-jet radio galaxies, thereby calling for a redefinition of our classification schemes. In the prospect of such surveys, and complementary multi-wavelength observations, I will discuss how we could use bent-jet radio galaxies as tracers of the “cluster weather”. These early efforts, in revamping radio-jet classification schemes and developing novel analysis methods to characterize the intracluster medium, are essential for the upcoming cascade of detections.",Marie-Lou Gendron-Marsolais,Contributed,Feedback (large scales and clusters),False,15:00,15:15,Thursday,,,,,,

Probing the impact of AGN feedback on gas distribution with SIMBA and IllustrisTNG simulations,"Jet activity from black holes are regarded as a major source of energy feedback to the CGM and are thought to be needed to regulate star-forming activity in galaxies. In simulations, there are several models of implementing this feedback mechanism, and they predict different properties for the CGM. This offers opportunities to distinguish them by confronting those predictions with observations. We first investigate the relation between the integrated tSZ y-decrement versus halo mass (Y-M), which can potentially constrain galaxy formation models. By studying the Y-M relation using the simulations, we find that the measured relations strongly depend on the adopted feedback models. Also, the current observations are complicated by observational systematics. We show that forthcoming facilities with arcminute resolution would retain the differences between model measurements and thereby provide strong constraints on AGN feedback. We further focus on the anisotropic behavior of the CGM and its relation to the AGN jet feedback simulations. Via stacking, we study the angular dependence of CGM properties around central galaxies. These anisotropic features may allow us to distinguish these feedback mechanisms in real observations.",Tianyi Yang,Contributed,Feedback (large scales and clusters),True,15:45,16:00,Thursday,,,,,,
"The enrichment of ""fossil"" radio electrons by multiple radio galaxies in clusters and in the cosmic web","Radio observations show that a volume-filling distribution of fossil relativistic electrons is needed to understand the emergence of diffuse radio emissions in cluster of galaxies (e.g. radio halos or radio relics), because such electrons are the necessary ""seeds"" used by Fermi I and II re-acceleration mechanisms to power radio emission. Radio galaxies are a viable candidate for the continuous seeding of such electrons in cosmic structures, but they are a difficult ingredient for modern numerical simulations as their modelling encompasses a challenging range of scales. I will present recent developments and results in the numerical simulation of this process, which potentially allows us to connect the visible an invisible activity of radio galaxies in crowded cosmic environments, and help us better constraining AGN energetics and duty cycle.

The Quasar Feedback Survey: zooming into the core of radio emission,"Understanding how quasars ``feedback'' on their host galaxies remains a significant challenge of galaxy formation theory. Observations have connected the prevalence of galaxy-wide ionised outflows to the level of radio emission and, consequently, show that understanding the origin of radio emission in typical quasar host galaxies is a key piece of the ``feedback'' puzzle. Towards addressing this, we are performing a systematic study of a representative sample of 71 quasars at z < 0.2 (LAGN ≳10^45 erg/s). Whilst VLA data have revealed that two thirds of the sample show jet/lobe structures on > ~kpc scales, the data are not sensitive to morphologies on smaller scales and show that majority of the radio emission is located in featureless/unresolved nuclear regions. Therefore, the origin of the significant radio emission remains unknown, resulting in missing critical insight into the quasar-host galaxy connection. Using e-MERLIN imaging at C-band, I will show how we are disentangling the different radio production mechanisms at sub-kpc scales. Combining e-MERLIN data with VLA data, we have determined the primary outflow driving mechanisms, and assessed the dominant source of radio emission, across physical scales of ~100pc to ~10kpc.",Ann Njeri,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,True,09:30,09:45,Friday,,,,,,
The Mass Assembly of High-Redshift Central Black Holes and the Emergence of Jetted AGN,"Recently, multiple questions about the growth of high-redshift supermassive black holes have been raised, regarding their accretion rates, duty cycles, and feedback. Most numerical simulations and semi-analytic models are able to reproduce the available galaxy and BH statistical observables at z~5-6, despite implementing different recipes for BH growth and feedback. Using a semi-analytic model of galaxy evolution in a cosmological context, we aim to break this degeneracy by showing how different BH growth models impact these same observables at z>5. We follow the mass build-up of galaxies covering the wide halo mass range between 10^8 and 10^13.5 solar masses, from z=20 to z=4, and we show how Eddington-limited and super-Eddington accretion models are both consistent with observational properties of SMBH and galaxies at z~5-6, but they become very clearly distinguishable at higher z and in the intermediate mass regime. Our model explicitly includes the interplay between the large-scale galactic gas cycle and BH accretion, so we can study how they influence each other in both scenarios. Adding physically-motivated assumptions on the BH spin and magnetic flux, we can also study the emergence of jetted AGN and their duty cycle.",Olmo Piana,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,09:45,10:00,Friday,,,,,,
Unraveling the galaxy assembly and AGN activity in a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z~3,"Galaxies form and evolve within the densest structures of the Universe where they are fed by filamentary inflows of gas from the Cosmic Web. However, the processes regulating how galaxies accrete their gas and how this affects their gas content and AGN activity are still largely unknown. A recent VLT/MUSE survey around a z~3 quasar finally provided us with one of the first images of contiguous cosmic filaments on Mpc-scales converging into a node containing a large concentration of galaxies and AGN. This represents a perfect laboratory to investigate how is the role of large-scale environment on the galaxy formation and AGN activity at high-z. In this talk I will present recent ALMA follow-up observations toward this massive node of the Cosmic Web. Our observations targeting CO emission lines as well as mm-dust continuum allowed us to obtain a complete census of star-forming galaxies in the field, constraint the galaxy ISM properties, and reveal the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas component of galaxies and AGN embedded in the Cosmic Web node. I will discuss how these observations, in conjunction with multiwavelength data from NIR to X-rays, shed light on the assembly of galaxies and AGN activity in dense environments.",Antonio Pensabene,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,10:00,10:15,Friday,,,,,,
Linking [OIII] outflows in AGN to low-frequency radio emission: new observations with LOFAR VLBI,"The nature of radio emission from radio quiet AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and how AGN feedback operates are two of the unsolved mysteries plaguing modern day radio astronomy. AGN show signatures of outflows which could explain how this feedback operates. Studies have connected [OIII] and radio emission. With radio surveys deeper than ever before, we can ask: What physical process causes the connection between [OIII] and radio emission? 

An instrument which can guide us closer to the answer is LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray). Using radio AGN in LoTSS (LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey) Boötes Deep Field, I compare radio properties to [OIII] 5007 kinematics. We compare outflow properties of 26 radio AGN at z<0.83 to 33 non radio detected AGN. We discover that 77% of radio AGN host an outflow compared to 23% of non radio AGN, indicating that radio AGN are more likely to host an [OIII] outflow compared to non radio AGN. 

To characterise the morphology of radio emission, we use Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). I will present the first sub-arcsecond resolution images at 144MHz, created using VLBI, of radio AGN within LoTSS Boötes Deep Field. This resolution is sufficient to determine if radio emission comes from jets or star formation.",Emily Escott,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,10:15,10:30,Friday,,,,,,

Black hole mass growth across cosmic time: Insights from the VLA-COSMOS survey,"Radio-mode AGN feedback is a regular ingredient in cosmological models. It is considered to be a key feedback mechanism at work in the latest phases of massive galaxy formation, and controlling the galaxy’s stellar mass build-up. Yet observationally it is still poorly understood. Over the past decades our understanding of radio AGN was significantly advanced by panchromatic look-back surveys. The VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project is based on 384 hours of observations with the upgraded, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array) at 3 GHz (10 cm) toward the two square degree COSMOS field. The survey, reaching a median rms of 2.3 uJy/beam over the two square degrees at an angular resolution of 0.75'', contains 10,830 radio sources down to 5 times the rms. It simultaneously provides the largest and deepest radio continuum survey at such angular resolution to date. These radio data, in conjunction with the panchromatic COSMOS data sets, allowed us to study the physical properties, composite nature (i.e., star-formation vs. AGN related contributions to the total radio emission of the sources), and cosmic evolution of radio AGN out to a redshift of about 6, which can directly be linked to the radio-mode feedback, as postulated in cosmological models.",Vernesa Smolcic,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,True,11:00,11:15,Friday,,,,,,
The nature of compact radio-loud AGN selected by LOFAR,"We investigate the nature of low-luminosity radio-loud AGN selected from LoTSS DR1. We have selected 55 radiative AGN candidates from LoTSS DR1 at redshift z<0.1. We show using high-frequency VLA observations that only 10 objects show extended radio emission (<3 kpc), 42 are compact at the angular limiting resolution of 0.35 arcsec (<1 kpc in projected physical size), while 3 are undetected. The extended objects display a wide range of radio morphologies: doubles, two-jet, core-jet, elongated, and complex. We discuss their radio spectra which range from steep to flat/inverted spectra and span the range seen in other compact AGN such as CSOs, CSSs, and GPSs. Assuming SSA for flat/inverted radio spectrum compact objects, we predict small physical sizes on parsec scales. The compact objects do not occupy a special position on the P-D diagram but share a region with low-radio power CSOs. Finally, we compare their radio properties with those of so-called “FR0s”. These differ from our targets mainly in their classification: FR0s are typically associated with low-excitation radio galaxies, whereas our objects are high-excitation radio galaxies. Studying these objects in the larger LoTSS DR2 will further our understanding of AGN feedback.",Jones Chilufya,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,11:15,11:30,Friday,,,,,,
Insights from Radio VLBI into the Central Engines of AGN feedback,"How AGN inject energy into their surroundings affects their impact on their host galaxies.  For the ~10%-20% of AGN which are “radio loud,” the interaction between the highly collimated relativistic jets emanating from closer to supermassive black hole (SMBH) and its surroundings are believed to result in “kinetic feedback” where gas is both head and pushed out of the galaxy, leading to a significant decrease in star formation rate.  However, this process is far less understood for the 80% - 90% of AGN which are “radio quiet,” where both the origin of the radio emission and mode of AGN feedback are unknown.  This talk will present the results derived from recent VLBI observations of a diverse sample of AGN – both quasars and lower-luminosity AGN associated with ionized gas outflows.  We will then demonstrate how these observations allow us to distinguish between different possible origins for the observed radio emission, each associated with either “kinetic” or “thermal” feedback.  Finally, we will present our initial findings which indicate that the origin of an AGN’s radio emission, and correspondingly the mode with which it affects its host galaxy, depends on its Eddington ratio.",Aisha Al Yazeedi,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,11:30,11:45,Friday,,,,,,
Cosmic evolution of jet-mode AGN feedback: discovery of a dominant new population at high-z,"Jet-mode AGN are thought to play a key role in the life-cycle of massive galaxies and clusters. However, the cosmic evolution of jet-mode AGN and their feedback effect remains largely unconstrained beyond z ~ 1. The LOFAR telescope has been undertaking one of the deepest wide-field radio continuum surveys to date: this represents a novel sample to statistically study the growth of AGN activity and feedback across cosmic time. Using a sample of > 10,000 AGN with excellent ancillary data, I will present the first robust measurement of the evolution of the jet-mode AGN population out to z ~ 2.5. We discover the existence of a new dominant population of jet-mode AGN hosted by star-forming galaxies at high redshifts that has not previously been observed. An analysis of the host-galaxy properties and duty cycle shows that the jet-mode AGN in star-forming galaxies are fuelled by a different mechanism compared to their quiescent counterparts. I will also present the evolution of jet-mode AGN feedback (i.e. kinetic heating output) and compare this with predictions from latest cosmological simulations, which shows evidence for a self-regulating feedback cycle in jet-mode AGN hosts since at least z~2.5.",Rohit Kondapally,Contributed,RQ AGN and evolutionary studies ,False,11:45,12:00,Friday,,,,,,
