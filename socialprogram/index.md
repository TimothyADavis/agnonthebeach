<b>Excursions</b><br>

For those interested, we will offer a choice of half-day excursions on the afternoon of Wednesday, 13th September.
One option will be an excursion in a sailing boat, which will allow you to admire the beauty of one of the most spectacular coastlines in the world. The tour will start from Tropea and will sail to Capo Vaticano and back, with various stops in between. At each stop, there will be the possibility to swim and go snorkelling (gear provided). An aperitif will be also offered aboard to the participants.

A second option will be a tour by land to Pizzo Calabro, a picturesque and historical town latched on a sea cliff and located about 30km from Tropea. The tour will allow you to discover all the secrets of the cliff-side “Murat Castle”, famously the place where Napoleon’s brother-in-law was imprisoned and assassinated, and the peculiar “Piedigrotta Church”, which is excavated into a rock face on the seashore. Pizzo Calabro is also famous as the home of a peculiar type of gelato, the so-called “Tartufo”. After a walk through the old town, you will have the pleasure to taste this delicious dessert, made of walnut ice-cream and melted dark chocolate in its core.
