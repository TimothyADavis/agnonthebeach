Outflows from AGN are believed to have a profound effect on the evolution of the host galaxy. The local input of the energy by the outflow into the ISM of the host galaxy can alter the physical state of the gas and regulate the star formation activity. We apply a turbulence-regulated model of star formation (published in Mandal et al. 2021) to explore how different processes, such as turbulence, gravity, and cooling affect the evolution of the dense star-forming gas being impacted by AGN-driven outflows. We apply this model to both galactic scale simulations of AGN jet-disk interaction as well as resolved simulations of collision between the outflows and individual star-forming clouds. The latter studies employ a newly developed Poisson solver in the PLUTO code to probe the impact of the self-gravity of dense clouds. We find that the shock from the outflow can induce turbulence inside the gas leading to reduced star formation. Also, the radiative shocks can compress the gas to a very high density making the cloud more prone to become gravitationally unstable to form stars. We also find that such systems can go through different evolutionary phases depending on the degree and strength of the interaction.
