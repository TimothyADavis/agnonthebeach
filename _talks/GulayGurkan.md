While observational studies suggest that kinetic or radiative feedback from powerful Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) may have substantial effects on their host galaxies, such feedback mechanism is required in numerical simulations of galaxies in order to match the observations. Although the significance of AGN feedback is well investigated in strong sources (statistically or a single source) we have only scratched the surface of the effects of AGN feedback in low-luminosity galaxies. The new-generation deep radio surveys from ASKAP on GAMA fields with excellent multi-wavelength coverage enabled us to select a sample of radiatively efficient (RE) AGN at lower radio luminosities than previously probed. Using this sample we investigated the link between outflows and radio emission from radiatively efficient AGN to gain insights into the mechanism that drives outflows. Our results show that the strong link between AGN outflows and radio emission exists in low-luminosity REAGN. In the light of these results, it is possible that core-scale jets can disturb the gas at a scale of a few tens of kpc from AGN.  In my talk I will discuss the results of this study and our future plans.
