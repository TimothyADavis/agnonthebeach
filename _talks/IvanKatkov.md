Galaxy-scale outflows are an important component of galaxy evolution models. Nevertheless, how they affect the host galaxy’s star formation and metal enrichment histories remains unclear. Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) can effectively launch such outflows producing hot gas and relativistic particles, which generate radio and optical emission. In this project, we are combining optical integral-field spectroscopy data from the MaNGA survey and sensitive radio observations with Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) to measure the properties of both components with comparable (~1-2”) angular resolution. In this talk, we will present a joint analysis of the radio morphology and spectrum, ionized gas kinematics, and the properties of the host galaxy for our sample of galaxies in conjunction with results concern the pc-scale radio emission of these AGN derived from VLBI observations. We demonstrate how, together, spatially resolved radio and optical data offer a more complete picture of the outflow’s energetics, kinematics, origin, and interaction with their surroundings.
