Relativistic jets from AGNs are an important driver of feedback in galaxies with an active black hole. They impact the nearby environment over different physical scales during their lifetime, with varying effects. Although the impact of such jets have primarily been considered in the context of heating the large scale environment, recent series of works over the last decade, both in observations and theory, have focused on their immediate impact on the host galaxy itself. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well its star formation.  However, to what extent such feedback are efficient in impacting the large scale gas in the galaxy is still a question of debate. I will review the results in this context both from observations and theoretical simulations, and discuss the potential caveats and open questions.
