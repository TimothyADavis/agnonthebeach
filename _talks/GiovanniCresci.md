Thanks to its existing extensive multi-wavelength coverage and to the massive and extended outflow detected both in the ionised and molecular components,  XID2028  at z=1.6 represents a unique test case to study QSO feedback in action at the peak epoch of AGN-galaxy coevolution. This target was thus selected to be observed with the NIRSpec and MIRI IFU on board of JWST during the Cycle 0 Early Release Science (ERS) campaign.
In this talk I will focus on the NIRSpec integral field dataset, which is revealing a wealth of details hidden in the previous, seeing limited ground-based data thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST instrumentation. In particular, we found evidence of interaction between the QSO-driven radio jet, outflow and the ISM of the galaxy, which is producing an expanding hot bubble from which the fast and extended wind detected in previous observations is emerging. The new observations confirm the complex interplay between the AGN wind and the ISM of the host galaxy, resulting in a showcase of the new window opened by NIRSpec and JWST on the detailed study of feedback at high redshift.
