Gas accretion by a galaxy's super massive black hole (SMBH) and the energetic
feedback by the accreting active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the gas around it
are two tightly intertwined processes. Observations of galaxy clusters have
shown how plasma jets emitted by the AGN heat the intracluster medium,
preventing cooling of the cluster gas and thus the infall of this gas onto the
SMBH. However, observations have also shown that rising plasma bubbles,
inflated by the jets, instead also induce local cooling of the cluster gas,
leading to filaments of cold gas. The fate of these filaments is unclear, but
it has been suggested they may feed the AGN activity. We present results
of re-processed CO(2-1) ALMA observations of the molecular gas in NGC 1275,
the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster hosting the radio-loud AGN 3C 84.
These data show, for the first time, in great detail how kpc-sized cold gas
filaments resulting from jet-induced cooling of cluster gas are flowing onto
the circumnuclear accretion disc of the SMBH, showing that the cooled gas does
indeed feed the AGN. These results complete our view of the feedback loop of
how an AGN can impact on its surroundings and how the effects from this impact
maintain the AGN activity.
