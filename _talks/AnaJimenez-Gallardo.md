Interactions between radio galaxies and their large-scale environments are key factors in the feedback processes responsible for triggering and fueling AGN activity and moderating galaxy evolution. To improve our understanding of such interactions, we carried out a multi-frequency analysis based on Chandra and VLT/MUSE observations of radio galaxies in the Third Cambridge Catalog. I will focus on our results on 3CR196.1, the potential first detection of an ionized gas bubble filling an X-ray cavity. I will discuss the different feeding/feedback features found, which make it a prime example of the interplay between multiphase gas haloes and radio jets. Lastly, I will present our preliminary results on the optical-to-X-ray comparison of a sample of 3CR radio galaxies. Apart from showcasing the morphological link between their extended X-ray and optical emission, sources with the same excitation state also display approximately constant X-ray to optical flux ratios. This result points to a different origin of the ionized gas surrounding radio galaxies as a function of their excitation state and supports the scenario in which the excitation state of radio sources is determined by their accretion material.
