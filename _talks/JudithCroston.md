I will review methods for estimating the power of AGN jets, and what they can tell us about different AGN populations, their powering mechanisms, and their connection to environment. I will consider questions that include: the reliability of scaling relations between radio observables and jet power, the factors that influence them, how jet power scaling relations may evolve with redshift, and what information we need to work towards reliable estimates of jet impact at high redshift. I will also highlight the wealth of information that new radio surveys are providing to address these questions.
