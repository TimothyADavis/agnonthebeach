For years we have grappled with the “cooling flow problem” in galaxy clusters, where the massive reserves of hot (10^7 K) gas in the intracluster medium (ICM) are observed to form stars with an efficiency of ~1%. AGN feedback seems to be the likely heating source for suppressing the expected runaway cooling, but many details of how this cooling-feedback balance is established are still unresolved. Thanks to recent SZ-based surveys, discoveries of thousands of high-redshift clusters have opened a new window for studying the evolving balance between their cooling ICM and associated star formation and AGN feedback. In this talk, we will present new results based on our large (N~100) unbiased sample of SZ-selected clusters discovered with the South Pole Telescope, spanning a redshift range (0.3<z<1.7) corresponding to 10 Gyr in evolution. Using multiwavelength follow-up from Chandra, Magellan, ASKAP, and others, we will address whether the effectiveness of feedback from AGN, and the ICM conditions that lead to their fueling, have evolved with time. We will also showcase the extremes among our sample (i.e. what happens when there’s too much heating or too much cooling), and how these can teach us about the limitations of AGN feedback.
