Outflows driven by AGN are now thought to be an important form of feedback, with statistical studies providing evidence for them being particularly powerful in galaxies with intermediate radio luminosities. While observations of the NLRs of such galaxies have revealed outflows on kpc scales and in a range of gas phases, their true impact remains unclear. Principally, this is because electron densities of the warm ionised phase (T>10,000K) are often underestimated, leading to outflow kinetic powers being overestimated. Furthermore, outflow acceleration mechanisms are ambiguous in many cases. In this talk, I will present the results of detailed studies of a small sample of nearby Seyfert galaxies that address these issues. In all cases, we find evidence for the NLR outflows being accelerated via shocks induced by jet-ISM interactions, despite the outflowing gas having ionisation conditions that are consistent with AGN-photoionisation. Moreover, using robust density diagnostics for the warm ionised phase, we find densities that are orders of magnitude above those commonly found, and thus derive much lower mass outflow rates. Overall, my talk will highlight the diverse conditions of jet-driven outflows on kpc-scales in local galaxies.
