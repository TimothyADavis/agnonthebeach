We present high-resolution integral field unit and Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations for Hercules A, the brightest cluster galaxy in the constellation of Hercules, a system that harbors radio jets. We find that not only is the ionized gas extended about ~ 31 kpc from the central engine along the direction of the radio jet but neither the weak accretion disk nor the ongoing merger can shape the ionized gas kinematics. Furthermore, we report that the jets are decelerating and picking up the dense (~ 250/cc) ionized gas as they traverse several kpc. distances. Our results strongly suggest that the radio jets are strongly interacting with the ambient medium and entraining gas in this process. Using the Chaotic Cold Accretion model of Gaspari et a. 2018, we estimate a mass outflow rate in the warm, ionized gas phase ~2800 solar mass/yr. Our findings show that radio jets can heat up the ambient medium and they are efficient at expelling a large amount of gas from their host galaxies' reservoir. Our results in Hercules A are hence crucial to understanding Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) driven feedback in the local universe.
