The search for jetted quasars at high redshift (z>5-6) is an active field with ground-breaking discoveries following each other. The existence of these objects is in fact a challenge for model of structure formation, as their radio power requires a very massive black hole, and represents an unique opportunity to investigate the formation and expansion of jets at cosmic dawn. Among the few known radio-loud quasars at z>6, CFHQS J142952+544717 is characterised by a moderate radio-loudness and an extremely high X-ray luminosity (>10^46 erg/s), as reported by eROSITA and XMM-Newton observations. VLBI observations showed a compact (<100 pc) but marginally resolved morphology and a brightness temperature (T_B~10^9 K) that  does not support an aligned jet, hence disfavouring Doppler boosting as the reason of the high X-ray luminosity, and possibly pointing to an initial stage of its radio activity. Here, we present the results of a ~30 ksec Chandra observation that allowed us to perform the first X-ray study of J1429 at sub-arcsecond resolution.
