Radio AGN in different evolutionary phases can be identified by their properties, like morphology and spectral indices. However, building large enough samples of radio sources in the most elusive phases of their evolution, like dying and restarted objects, has been always challenging. Only by characterising these phases, the full duty cycle can be quantified.
