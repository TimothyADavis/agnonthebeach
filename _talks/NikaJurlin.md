Radio galaxies dominate the sky at radio wavelengths and represent an essential piece in the galaxy evolution puzzle. The AGN's activity oscillates between periods of quiescence and activity, yet the triggering mechanisms are poorly understood. Identifying large samples of restarted radio galaxies is crucial for understanding these mechanisms, but it is challenging due to their low radio luminosities and complex morphologies.
In this talk, I will present morphological and spectral properties of restarted radio sources selected from LOFAR data (144 MHz, 0.3'' - 18'' resolution) in the Lockman Hole field (25 sqdeg). Using these results, we developed a novel technique to automatize the selection of restarted radio sources in vast data sets. This approach builds upon DISCCOFAN, an image-processing method that can extract structures using morphology-based criteria. We apply this method to identify restarted radio galaxies in the HETDEX field (424 sqdeg) and show that it can accurately select restarted radio galaxies with high confidence. Our results demonstrate the potential of using automated ways to identify these elusive objects in the LOFAR data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the duty cycle of radio galaxies.
