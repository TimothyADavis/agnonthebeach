Jet activity from black holes are regarded as a major source of energy feedback to the CGM and are thought to be needed to regulate star-forming activity in galaxies. In simulations, there are several models of implementing this feedback mechanism, and they predict different properties for the CGM. This offers opportunities to distinguish them by confronting those predictions with observations. We first investigate the relation between the integrated tSZ y-decrement versus halo mass (Y-M), which can potentially constrain galaxy formation models. By studying the Y-M relation using the simulations, we find that the measured relations strongly depend on the adopted feedback models. Also, the current observations are complicated by observational systematics. We show that forthcoming facilities with arcminute resolution would retain the differences between model measurements and thereby provide strong constraints on AGN feedback. We further focus on the anisotropic behavior of the CGM and its relation to the AGN jet feedback simulations. Via stacking, we study the angular dependence of CGM properties around central galaxies. These anisotropic features may allow us to distinguish these feedback mechanisms in real observations.
