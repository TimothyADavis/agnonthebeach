AGN can have an impact on their host galaxy via radiation, outflows and relativistic jets from them by their capability to heat, compress and/or remove gas, at different scales. On an observational perspective, the impact of AGN on their host galaxies is a matter of debate. To understand the complex connection between AGN and the ISM of their hosts at small scale, we present the studies of one nearby AGN host galxay, NGC4395. NGC4395 hosts a IMBH, having mass 10^4 - 10^5 M_sun and situtated at a distance of ~4.5 Mpc. Using optical IFU data from GMOS, we found the presence of ionized outflowing gas, co-spatial with resolved radio jet like structure at 15 GHz at 10 pc scale. The asymmetry in the ionized [OIII] line and the high velocity dispersion indicates that the medium is kinematically disturbed. Using CLOUDY and MAPPING III model, we found the ionization is to be due to shocks. The power of the jet is ~10^39 erg/s which is higher than the power of ionized outflowing gas (~4x10^36 erg/s). From Gemini-NIFS and ALMA data, we found a spatial offset of cold molecular gas (CO 2-1) relative to nuclear hot molecular gas (H2 2.408 um) favouring a scenario of the AGN inhibiting star formation on 10 pc scale.
