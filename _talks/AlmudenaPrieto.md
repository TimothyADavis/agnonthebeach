Low luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) represent the vast majority of the AGN population in the near universe. Their relatively large BH masses and low luminosity place them in the very low Eddington ratio regime, and still, despite their low radiative significance, their main main channel for release of energy is thought to be mechanical via  their jets.
I will show that parsec-scale observations across the electromagnetic spectrum of some of the nearest low Eddington cases reveal their spectral energy distribution to be fundamentally   dominated by jet emission  over circa  ten order of magnitude in frequency. Moreover,  some of these nuclei show a highly ionised spectrum of coronal lines in the IR. When resolution permits,  this emission show extended and collimated over parsec scales in the jet direction.  I will discuss  how these lines become  genuine tracers of  the  mechanical power dumped by the jet into the medium. On the basis of the energetics so far estimated, the  net balance between  radiative  and mechanical power in these sources will be presented.
