X-ray observations of galaxy clusters have revealed the presence of spiraling gas sloshing features, (~95% in cool core (CC) clusters). These features are believed to arise from the motion of the intracluster medium induced by mergers or other disturbances. While simulations of merging clusters have reproduced such features, their limitations (e.g., merging is rare in CC clusters) have prompted the investigation of alternative mechanisms. AGN feedback is one such mechanism, and its potential role in driving gas sloshing has been the focus of recent research. We present evidence of gas sloshing motion in a cosmic ray (CR) dominated AGN jet feedback simulation of galaxy clusters. Our simulation shows spiral-like gas sloshing features with a scale of 20-100 kpc, consistent with some current X-ray observations of CC clusters. We investigated the results in various projections and compared them with real X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM Newton. Our findings suggest that AGN jet feedback can drive gas sloshing in galaxy clusters. These findings have important implications for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters and the role of AGN feedback in shaping their properties.
