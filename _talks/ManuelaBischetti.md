In this talk I will present the first systematic characterization of the far-infrared to radio properties in a statistical sample of luminous (L~1E47 erg/s) quasars at z~2-4, that is during the peak epoch of quasar number density. To this purpose, I will exploit state-of-the-art, dedicated millimeter and centimeter observations with ALMA, NOEMA, JVLA, as also radio data from the LOTSS DR2 survey. I will show that quasars classically defined as “radio-quiet” are in fact routinely detected (detection rate 80-90%) and often show extended (>tens of kpc) radio morphologies. I will discuss whether nuclear emission or star formation  in the quasar host galaxy (100-1000 Msun/yr) mostly contribute to the radio emission. Finally, I will discuss the relative role of “quasar mode” and “radio mode”  feedback mechanisms in the brightest luminosity regime.
