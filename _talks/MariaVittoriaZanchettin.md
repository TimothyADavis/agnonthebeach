I will discuss the physics of the multiphase gas in local active galaxies and the impact of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) on the host galaxy evolution. AGNs can generate winds and jets that interact with the host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM). I will focus on the warm ionized, cold molecular phases and radio properties, using MUSE/VLT, ALMA and VLA data.
I will present a detailed dynamical modelling of the gas component through which we can reconstruct the distribution and kinematics of the discs, winds, jets and their interaction.
By exploiting spatially resolved MUSE multi-line diagnostics, we are able to derive the best estimate of the velocity field, spatial distribution, and electron density, therefore properly quantify the ionized mass and outflow energetics. By comparing high resolution radio and sub-mm data of the central region we are able to infer the presence of compact radio-jets, star formation activity and dust emission on sub-kpc scales.
I will present the application of our approach to a sample of local hard-X-ray selected Seyfert galaxies, including NGC2992. In this object VLA data shows the presence of star formation activity in the disc and of expanding radio bubbles interacting with the surrounding ISM.
