Understanding the physical processes that connect Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to their host galaxies remains an ongoing challenge of extragalactic astrophysics. On the one hand, it is well established that powerful jets can regulate cooling of galactic halo gas, at least in the densest environments. However, there is now a plethora of observational evidence that jets, of all powers, can influence their host galaxies and larger environments in multiple ways. This includes: (1) increased turbulence in the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM); (2) induced shocks/excitation in ionised and molecular ISM; (3) removal of ISM gas in outflows; (4) interaction between radio lobes and molecular gas on circumgalactic scales. In addition to these negative `feedback’ effects, there is evidence for localised jet-induced star formation in some targets. This jet-induced processes appear to also be important in radiatively dominant (‘radio quiet’) AGN, which can be missed without sensitive radio observations. In this review talk I will give a brief overview of these types of observations and use this to introduce the more detailed talks on specific observational campaigns.
