The Royal Astronomical Society expects to issue a number of press releases on the exciting research presented at the meeting. Embargoed copies will be made available to journalists several days in advance, to aid them in preparing their stories.

A press room will be available at the conference venue for journalists to work in, along with a suitable space for interviews. RAS press office staff will be on hand to assist journalists e.g. in finding suitable scientists to comment on stories.

All press releases will be archived on this page.
